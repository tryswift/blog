try! Swift is a two-day conference, an immersive community gathering about Swift Language, best practices in Swift, Application Development in Swift, Server-Side Swift, Open Source Swift with more than 500 attendees, 20+ speakers, workshops, and a grand party! 

Some things that make try! Swift unique from other conferences: 

International: try! Swift is all about connecting people across different cultures, languages & countries, breaking the barriers, and making the world smaller! Most of our speakers are from different parts of the world and we make sure they get connected and immersed with the local developer community. Our conferences also tend to have a large international participation resulting in creating amazing connections, which is personally the most rewarding aspect of the conference. 

Personal:  As we said, the goal of the try! Swift is really to bring people together. In addition to 20-minute talks by our impressive speakers, attendees could connect with the speakers at office hours. This is very important since there aren't many conferences out there that provide this kind of access to speakers. While the official office hours are timed at 20 minutes, there are times when they grow into bigger discussions making them the most valuable part of the conference for both the attendees and the speakers. (one of them took couple of hours!)

Community-driven: Even though try! Swift is an international conference, we really focus on the needs of the local community and canâ€™t make it happen without the support of the local community. In fact, it was the local communities were keen on bringing try! Swift to India! We are making sure to tailor the content and the conference to the needs of the local community. Based on our discussions with the local communities and companies during our travels in India, we realized the high interests & voracious appetite for learning Swift. As a result, we'll be hosting optional workshops on Swift for Beginners and Advanced levels the day before the main event. This offers the attendees a chance to improve their Swift skills before attending the talks from our expert speakers. 

We look forward to seeing you in the next try! Swift Conference!
