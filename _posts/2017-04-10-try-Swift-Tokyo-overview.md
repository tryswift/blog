This article is an overview of the try! Swift Tokyo Conference, which happened in early March 2017.

It has been almost three months since we the second annual try! Swift conference in Tokyo. With 30+ Speakers, 30+ Sponsors, and 700+ attendees, it was the biggest Swift conference in the world! try! Swift Tokyo took place over three days - with the first two days dedicated to international speaker presentations, and the last day to workshops and a hands-on hackathon!

try! Swift is not just a conference, it is a community. The main goal of the conference is to bring developers from all over the world together to create one big family. That is why try! Swift focuses on creating extra opportunities for networking.

The day before the conference, [Pivotal Labs](https://pivotal.io/) sponsored a special International Reception for all of our international speakers and guests to get to know each other and become friends, so the they are less lonely at the conference the next day. This also gives space for speakers to get to know each other and some of the attendees, so they are more comfortable at the conference the next day and are able to deliver the best presentations to their friends instead of 700+ strangers!

It was an amazing experience - Pivotal Labs sponsored food and drinks for everyone. Speakers were so happy, they were walking around, talking to everyone, playing table tennis! It's so fun when worlds most talented people meet each other in a fun and friendly atmosphere.

We also made sure to arrange a special experience for all speakers and attendees, a moment to take a deep breath from the sky at [Tokyo City View and Sky Deck](http://www.roppongihills.com/tcv/en/). Imagine looking at Tokyo from the top of the world and seeing the sunset with a clear view of Mount Fuji... it was a special moment indeed!

Meanwhile, there were a lot of different other events going on around Tokyo organized by the local community and conference attendees, including a [Fastlane Meetup](https://ookami.connpass.com/event/50553/), [Swift Meetup w/ Healthy Japanese Food](https://finc.connpass.com/event/50693/), and [Mario Cart](https://twitter.com/orta/status/837059063053635587)!!

## Day 1 ##
It was a beautiful morning, except for all that chilly weather and drizzling... It was so hard for international attendees to wake up early in the morning and get to the conference venue at [Belle Salle Shinjuku Park](http://www.bellesalle.co.jp/room/bs_shinjuku/access.html), but they made it! On the way, there was a beautiful park. Some of us intentionally walked through it to absorb the fresh morning energy and listen to the chirping of Japanese birds.

When we reached there sharp at 06:00 AM, the conference hall was ready. There was a big main screen with two sub-screens in the middle, with chairs and tables properly arranged. We stood at one end of the conference hall and took a deep breath imagining it fill up with all the amazing people in only a few more hours. Trust me, that was spectacular.

Do you recognize the Japanese and English words in the sign below? Yes, the conference was bilingual. Since we organize the conference in the heart of Japan, most of the attendees were Japanese-speakers, so we made sure everyone understood where to go and what to do!

We hired an amazing Japanese / English translation team to simultaneously translate each talk from English to Japanese or from Japanese to English. We gave out wireless receivers to attendees who wanted to hear the translation. To hear the translation, they just had to tune the device to the correct channel. More attendees had to use this device and loved it! It's a truly magical experience to hear a talk translated like that!

As time passed, our amazing volunteers set everything up and attendees started coming in. There were over 500 attendees in the conference hall by 09:00 AM!

This year's conference badge was the beautiful Riko bird wearing a cute Japanese Kimono with the Imperial Palace in the background. The whole scene comes to life with heart-shaped Sakura leaves falling down from the sky through the milky clouds. Thanks to our fantastic designer and contributor [Yucovin](https://twitter.com/yucovin) for this incredible work!!

The conference started 09:45 AM sharp, it was a continuing process. There was a new speaker every twenty minutes with a few lightning talks in between. Attendees who had more in-depth questions about each topic had the option to go meet the speaker in a designated Q&A room after the talk. The Q&A room was very busy, and soon turned into a fun social discussion room with the speakers!

A light breakfast, coffee and snacks, and of course lunch were provided throughout the day. At lunch, attendees could choose from a variety of delicious Japanese lunch boxes [ Bento ]. There were vegetarian, no-seafood, and meat and seafood options available for people with different food restrictions.

Later in the evening, we organized a special Speaker & Sponsor party with food, drinks, and karaoke! It was super fun with many speakers and local developers from local companies singing and dancing. Some of the speakers sang Karaoke to English songs, but there were also a few non-Japanese people singing Japanese songs - those were the most impressive! Some Japanese developers sang songs by Linkin Park in English! It will be hard to forget those good moments - coming together as a community and breaking the language barrier... in song!

## Day 2 ##
This year's try! Swift Tokyo conference had 30+ amazing sponsors. Without our sponsors, try! Swift simply wouldn't be possible. Sponsoring an event like this is one exposes amazing companies and products to 700+ Swift / iOS developers around the world. With this much exposure, companies increase their brand value, making recruiting talented iOS developers much easier among other benefits. The opportunities are endless.

 Gold and Platinum sponsors had amazing booths set up throughout the conference, and attendees had the chance to roam around and take a look at each and every company. Sponsors provided fresh coffee, natural juices, sponsor swag, food, and great conversation!

On the second evening, we organized a big party for all conference attendees at a gothic-themed cafe, with fun chandeliers, demon statues, lit candles, and food and drinks for everyone. It was the moment for everyone to come out of the conference hustle and really come together as a community that we have all built over the past two days. Everyone was talking and connecting with everyone :)

## Day 3 ##

Since our try! Swift Japan community is s big, two-day conference and bunch of workshops were not enough. That's why we came up with the idea of conducting a hackathon, and it turned out to be an amazing event. More than 130 people participated in the hackathon so many got prizes, who doesn't love Nintendo Switch? Yes, we gave out Nintendo Switches to winners.

It is so wonderful to see that people trying to accomplish amazing things in the hackathon, we saw a team trying to connect to this Robot using Swift Programming Language, well, that was really crazy. There were much more crazy ideas like this, people were building Xcode plugins, Server-Side Swift tools, Apps, translation tools, and much more.

We have organized the workshops and hackathon parallel. There were three workshops IBM Kitura workshop, Realm workshop, and 2D game workshop. People loved all of these workshops. Attendees got their personal time with world-class speakers, they got more attention, and they learned a lot from the full day classroom style workshop. It was more like an interactive session, solving problems, grasping industry best practices and learning about the product. Photos from workshops are given below;

Finally, selecting the winners in hackathon was a huge task to us. We could not really choose one team because most of the team come with crazy working products. It was a tough task for us. That's why we decided to go for public voting. One of our organizers came up with this amazing idea of voting. We have given two color circular dots to all hackathon attendees, attendees can stick those dots in their favorite team's name. People were so confused after the presentation, the top ten ideas were really good, and it was really hard a person to choose the best two from them. Finally, we have given out Nintendo Switches, and other gifts to all winners and participants. Hackathon was super fun.

We still feel the energy of the conference, it feels like it just happened yesterday. try! Swift Conference attendees learned a lot, observed a lot, enjoyed a lot, and made a lot of connections. People who have attended try! Swift shared their love via #tryswiftconf hashtag in Twitter, do check it out.

try! Swift Conference is not a community now, it is a Family. A Family of Swifters.

Thanks to amazing organizers & volunteers who all have helped to make this happen. Without these people, this would not have this much amazing. Their hard-work and dedication to the community are priceless.
