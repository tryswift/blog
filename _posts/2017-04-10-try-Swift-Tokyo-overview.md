This article is an overview of try! Swift Tokyo Conference which happened on 2nd & 3rd of March 2017.

It has been two months since try! Swift Tokyo Conference. 34+ Speakers, 50+ Sponsors, and 732+ attendees, it has been one of the best and big Swift conference in the world. It was a three-day conference in which two days were the conference with one full day workshops and hackathon.

try! Swift is not a platform, it’s a community of Swift Developers and Apple Technology fanatics. try! Swift gives more importance to networking, the conference itself is mainly focused on creating a Developer Community in the country rather than just organizing a conference.  It's all about community and coming together as a family. That’s why try! Swift have organized a special Speakers meet-up in Pivotal Labs on March 1st. Before we organize the conference we need to give a space for speakers to get to know each other, once these speakers from all around the world are happy, once they connect with all other speakers they are like a team. A team, who's primary concern is to deliver best quality content to try! Swifters. It was an amazing experience, Pivotal Labs sponsored food & drinks for everyone, speakers were so happy, they were walking around, talking to everyone, playing table tennis, it's so fun when worlds most talented people meet each other and have drinks. Also, try! Swift took care of giving a special moment for all speakers, a moment to take a deep breathe from the sky in the Tokyo City SkyDeck View. It was an incredible view, looking at the Tokyo city from the top of the world and seeing the sun hiding in Mount Fuji are the best moments ever.

It was a beautiful morning, a morning which is excluded from the drizzling. it was so hard for International attendees to wake up early in the morning and run to the conference hall, it was super chilly. Walking through Tokyo city in the early morning is very nice. Near to the conference hall, we got a beautiful garden, even though we don't have to walk through the garden to reach the conference hall, we intentionally walk through it to absorb the fresh morning energy and also to listen to the chirping of Japanese birds. 

This year we have organized the Tokyo conference in Belle Shinjuku Park, it's a big conference hall, it can easily accommodate around 1000+ people. When we reached there at 06:00 AM, it was ready, there was a big main screen with two sub-screens in the middle, chairs and tables were properly arranged. I Stood at one end of the conference hall and took a deep breath by looking at 700+ chairs and three screens. Trust me, that was really crazy.

Did you recognize the Japanese & English words in the board given below? Yes, the conference was bilingual. Since we organize the conference in heart of Japan, we need Japanese people to attend the conference even if they don't know English, that was one of our main mottoes.

We hired a Japanese translation team, they have done an amazing work. Also, we have given out 700+ wireless receivers to attendees. If they want to listen to English translation of speaker talk and announcements, they have to just turn on the device and tune into channel 2, and channel 1 for Japanese. We are really glad that we could implement this, all attendees got use it and they loved it. Normally when a Japanese person ask a doubt to the speaker, the non-Japanese people have no idea what's going on, they just tune into channel 2 and listen to real-time translation of the conversation. It was one of the amazing thing we have done in the conference.

While we were setting up the whole conference hall, we saw this amazing thing, this conference attendee came at 06:00 AM. We could see that dedication. Just one hour later people came, there was already a queue by 07:00 AM.

This year's conference id card was beautiful, Riko bird, wearing cute Japanese Kimono with Imperial Palace in the background. The whole scene get's more life when Sakura leaves falling down from the sky through the milky clouds. Thanks to our fantastic designer and contributor Yuconvin for this incredible work.

This year's Tokyo conference was blessed by 50+ sponsors, Thanks to all sponsors for making this happen, without these sponsors try! Swift Conference would not have this beautiful and amazing. Sponsoring an event like this is one of the best things. The company logo and its products will be seen by 800+ people and if you have a stall they will come explore your products more. Sponsoring an International Conference with 800+ attendees is a huge thing if you are a company owner you are literally pushing your company to the mainstream. Eventually, your brand value gets increased, attendees will reach out to you regarding job opportunities, and much more. The opportunities are endless.

 There were a lot of sponsors with stalls, it was really fun to roam around and take a look at each and every product. There were fresh coffee, natural juice, sponsor swags, and food.

The conference started sharp at 09:45 AM, it was a continuing process. In every twenty a new speaker comes to the stage gives his/her talk and goes to the Q & A room, where attendees can ask doubts to the speakers, it was more like a discussion room. 

Lunch time, we have provided four or five different type of Japanese lunch boxes [ Bento ]. There was vegetarian and not vegetarian food since some [ 200+ ] of our attendees are foreigners we had to take care of vegetarian food too. Japanese don't know what is a vegetarian food, they always have meat or fish mixed food items. So it was really hard to get customized vegetarian bento lunch boxes.

Later in the evening, we have organized a special Speaker party in a Japanese Karaoke room with food & drinks. It was super fun, more than 30 speakers were singing and dancing, no one will easily forget those good moments. Some of the speakers did Karaoke to some English songs, there were other non-Japanese people doing karaoke in Japanese songs, those were the craziest. Also, there was a Japanese person, who was singing a Linkin Park song in front of native English speakers. These moments were priceless, coming together as a community and breaking the bilingual barrier, that was one of the amazing achievement of try! Swift Conference. 

On the second day evening, we organized a party for all conference attendees. It was a huge place and it could accommodate more than 700 members easily. It was a Christian themed cafe, with lights, demons statues, and lit candles. We have arranged food and drinks for everyone. It was the moment for everyone to come out of the conference hustle. Attendees could easily talk to speakers. Everyone was talking and connecting with everyone, a pure networking event.

Since our try! Swift Japan community is s big, two-day conference and bunch of workshops were not enough. That's why we came up with the idea of conducting a hackathon, and it turned out to be an amazing event. More than 130 people participated in the hackathon so many got prizes, who doesn't love Nintendo Switch? Yes, we gave out Nintendo Switches to winners. 

![try! Swift Tokyo Hackathon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tryswift/blog/master/images/tokyo-2017/hackathon.jpg)

It is so wonderful to see that people trying to accomplish amazing things in the hackathon, we saw a team trying to connect to this Robot using Swift Programming Language, well, that was really crazy. There were much more crazy ideas like this, people were building Xcode plugins, Server-Side Swift tools, Apps, translation tools, and much more. 

![try! Swift Tokyo Hackathon Robot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tryswift/blog/master/images/tokyo-2017/hackathon-robot.jpg)

We have organized the workshops and hackathon parallel. There were three workshops IBM Kimura workshop, Realm workshop, and 2D game workshop. People loved all of these workshops. Attendees got their personal time with world-class speakers, they got more attention, and they learned a lot from the full day classroom style workshop. It was more like an interactive session, solving problems, grasping industry best practices and learning about the product. Photos from workshops are given below;

Finally, selecting the winners in hackathon was a huge task to us. We can't really choose one team because most of the team come with crazy working products. It was a tough task for us. That's why we decided to go for public voting. One of our organizers came up with this amazing idea of voting. We have given two color circular dots to all hackathon attendees, attendees can stick those dots in their favorite team's name. People were so confused after the presentation, the top ten ideas were really good, and it was really hard a person to choose the best two from them. Finally, we have given out Nintendo Switches, and other gifts to all winners and participants. Hackathon was super fun.
