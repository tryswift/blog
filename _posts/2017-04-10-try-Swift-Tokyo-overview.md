This article is an overview of try! Swift Tokyo Conference which happened on 2nd & 3rd March 2017.

It has been two months since the try! Swift Tokyo Conference. 34 Speakers, 50+ Sponsors, and 732 attendees, it has been one of the best and big Swift conference in the world. It was a three-day conference in which two days were conference and 1 full day workshops and hackathon.

try! Swift is not a platform, it’s a community, which gives more importance to networking. That’s why try! Swift have organised a special Speakers meet-up in Pivotal Labs on March 1st. It was an amazing experience, speakers from around the world got know each other, Pivotal Labs have provided food & drinks for everyone, people were so happy. Also try! Swift took all speakers to the Tokyo City SkyDeck View, it was an incredible view, looking at the Tokyo city from top of the world and seeing sun hiding in Mount Fuji are the best moments ever.

It was a beautiful morning, it was so hard for foreigners to wake up early in the morning and run to conference hall, it was super chilly. Walking through Tokyo city in early morning is very nice. Near to the conference hall we got a beautiful garden, eventhough we don't have to walk through the garden to reach the conference hall, we intentionally walk through it to absorb fresh morning energy from the garden also to listen to chirping of Japanese birds. 

This year we have organised the Tokyo conference in Belle Shinjuku Park, it's a conference hall, it can easily accommodate around 1000+ people. When we reached there at 06:00 AM, it was ready, there was a big main screen with two sub screens in the middle, Stood at one end of the conference hall and took a long breathe by looking at 700+ chairs and three screens.

While we were setting up the whole conference hall, we saw this amazing thing, this conference attendee came at 06:00 AM. We could see that dedication. Just one hour later people came, there were already a queue by 07:00 AM.

The whole scene get's more life when Sakura leaves falling down from the sky through the milky clouds. Thanks to our fantastic designer and contributor Yuconvin for this incredible work.
